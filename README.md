Hello there!
This is Vinit, a creative software engineer with over 2 years of experience in the corporate world.

I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Samsung Research America, where I had this incredible opportunity to collaborate with research scientists, engineers, and designers to incorporate cutting-edge technology into novel prototypes for developing new software products that bring new business opportunities for Samsung. I have explored a variety of domains, including full-stack development, 3D Multiplayer Collaboration, Virtual Reality, and Metaverse, to name a few!.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science (AI) at Northwestern University, which is ranked among the top ten universities in the United States. 

Prior to this, I worked as a Software Developer at Barclays - the bank that invented the first ATM machine...! At Barclays, I was involved in the end-to-end development of the software applications, which had more than a million users across the world. So, I know what technical abilities it takes to develop software from scratch with such a massive user base.

I also strengthened my leadership skills on the side, by leading the team for the development of in-house tools for the upliftment of Barclays colleagues, which was in line with the Barclays values of stewardship, which is leaving things better than we found them. I always try to adopt this value of leaving things in a better condition than I found them and making an impact.

I am a huge music lover (guitar and piano, to be exact!). In that vein, I invented AirMusic, a real-time AI-based music composition system that generates music based on your moves! Simply dance in front of your webcam and let the party begin:)

I'm looking forward to working for an innovative firm where I can leverage my expertise, as well as my vast experience as a software developer at Samsung Research and Barclays. I want to work on challenging problems, create incredible products, and put a dent in the universe!

Technical Skills:
