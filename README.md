### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

Hi Everyone, I am Vinit Todai, a creative software engineer with over 2 years of experience in software development and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University, which is ranked among the top ten universities in the United States. Prior to this, I worked as a Software Developer at Barclays - the bank who invented the first ATM machine...!.

I have been experimenting a lot in the field of Artificial Intelligence and and its applications in Robotics, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, and Brain computer interfaces.

I'm looking forward to working for an innovative firm where I can leverage my Artificial intelligence and machine learning expertise, as well as my prior experience as a software developer at Barclays. I want to work on challenging problems, create incredible products, and work for a company that is out to put a dent in the universe.
